# Maze-Generator
A command-line program generating a character-based maze using Disjoint Set data structure
This Java project generates a random maze puzzle which can be seen in newspapers.
This project uses disjoint sets where every cell of the maze is a disjoint set on its own.
A random cell is picked and checked with its neighbors, if they do not lie in the same disjoint cell(i.e. there is a wall between the cells or they aren't connected via any other cell), then the wall is broken between them and they are then put in the same disjoint set.
This process continues until all the cells are in the same disjoint set.
Thus, in the end, all the cells are connected to each other directly or indirectly which increases the complexity of the maze.
